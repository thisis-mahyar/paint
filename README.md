# paint

This project is a simplified version of the Windows Paint program, developed as an educational exercise to demonstrate and reinforce key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using Java and Swing.

The application provides a canvas where users can create and manipulate various shapes. Users can choose their desired shapes from the menu and draw them. The application also allows users to erase, move, zoom in, and zoom out on the shapes.

This project originated as an assignment in my Advanced Programming course. The initial framework was provided by my instructor. While I re-implemented the entire project, referring to my instructor’s code, I made minor optimizations and corrections where necessary. These refinements, though subtle, improved the overall efficiency. I wanted to acknowledge the source of the project’s foundation.
